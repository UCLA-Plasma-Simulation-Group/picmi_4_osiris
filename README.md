# picmi_4_osiris
PICMI Interface for OSIRIS Input files

This is a repo for python/C/whatever codes that are being used to convert PICMI files into OSIRIS.  

The PICMI standard can be found here:

At the moment, WARPX and FBPIC both supports the PICMI standard, and we will embrace it and try to extend it so it can be used on a wide range of problems that is currently being performed on OSIRIS.
